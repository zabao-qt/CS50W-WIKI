# Mark Zuckerberg

## Early Life
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York. He was raised in the nearby village of Dobbs Ferry, New York, by his parents Karen, a psychiatrist, and Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist. Mark developed an early interest in computers and programming, learning Atari BASIC Programming from his father and later hiring a private tutor, David Newman, to advance his skills. By the time he was in middle school, he had already created a messaging program named "ZuckNet" for his family's dental practice.

## Education
Zuckerberg attended Ardsley High School, where he excelled in classes and earned a reputation as a programming prodigy. He later transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, a prestigious preparatory school in New Hampshire, where he continued to excel academically and won prizes in science (math, astronomy, and physics) and classical studies. During his high school years, he also built a music player called Synapse Media Player, which used machine learning to learn users' listening habits. Several companies, including AOL and Microsoft, expressed interest in buying the software and hiring Zuckerberg, but he opted to attend Harvard University instead.

### Harvard University

## Founding Facebook
In February 2004, Zuckerberg launched "The Facebook" from his Harvard dormitory room. Initially, the site was limited to Harvard students but quickly expanded to other Ivy League universities, and then to colleges and universities across the United States and Canada. By the end of 2004, Facebook had nearly 1 million users.

Under Zuckerberg's leadership, Facebook rapidly grew into a global social networking giant. The platform continuously evolved, adding new features like the News Feed, Messenger, and various privacy controls to enhance user experience. Over the years, Facebook acquired several companies to expand its services and influence, including:
